What is an interpreted language?

High level interpreted language, don’t have to worry about memory management, as in a low level language like C or C++. Interpreted means the program is executed directly, instead of running it through a complier, as in the case of Java which is runs through a compiler. Java is a compiled language, so has a compiler is used to run it. 

In contrast Javascript is a scripting interpreted language.
